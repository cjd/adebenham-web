No matter how hard we try to tread lightly and care for the cliff environment, the potential impacts of climbing are considerable. Observing the Code of Conduct set out below will help to lessen that impact. At the cliff face: 
<UL>
<LI> Tread lightly and avoid fragile vegetation at the base and top of cliffs. Once vegetation is removed erosion sets in and the resulting soil loss could mean that revegetation is not possible 
<LI>  Avoid removing vegetation from cracks and ledges when developing new cliffs and climbs. 
<LI>  Where possible on approaches to the bottom, and from the top of climbs, keep to rocks, hard ground, and established tracks. 
<LI>  Avoid revegetation/regeneration areas until signs have been officially removed and the area has recovered. 
<LI>  Carry all rubbish out with you. 
<LI>  Practice minimum impact toileting by going well away (more than 50m) from tracks and creeks and digging a deep hole to bury all human waste matter, toilet paper and tissues; or use a  poo tube  to carry it out with you. 
<LI>  To avoid trampling cliff top vegetation where possible use  lower-offs  to return to the base of climbs. 
<LI>  Minimise chalk usage. Chalk is unsightly; think before you dip ! Consider using appropriately coloured chalk. 
<LI>  Bolting can be unsightly; place them with consideration for low visual impact as well as safety. Consider using coloured brackets or painting them to match the rock. 
<LI>  When choosing a site for a  lower-off  point, consider proximity to other climbs below as well as visual impact. 
<LI>  Marking the start of climbs should be done discretely and in keeping with accepted practices at particular cliffs. 
<LI>  Chipping or enhancing of holds is unacceptable. 
<LI>  Always comply with the regulations attached to particular areas. 
<LI>  Respect the Aboriginal and European cultural heritage which exists in some areas. With regard to other cliff users: 
<LI>  Avoid monopolising climbs and crags. Think of others waiting their turn. 
<LI>  Take care with loose rock at the top of climbs or on climbs. Signal immediately and loudly with  ROCK  or  BELOW  if any is accidentally knocked down. 
<LI>  Look below for others before throwing down ropes. 
<LI>  Climbers are not the only users of some areas. Respect the rights of these other users. 
<LI>  Consider the possible dangers of bringing small children to the cliff face. Is it really safe for them? Could they be a nuisance to others? 
<LI>  Please note: Dogs are not allowed in National Parks, and on Council owned lands must be kept on a lead. 
</ul>
<B>REMEMBER THAT WE DO NOT HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO CLIFF FACES. </b><BR>
Hopefully a pleasant interaction with other cliff users will continue despite the increasing pressure of numbers.<br>
