The Area covered by this guide extends from the cliffs of Joels Bridge in the south, up to the tip of the wyong area in the north.  The creators of this guide all live in the Gosford area and so not much is written about the Wyong area but over time more will be added<br>
</p>

<p class=text>
On the coast there is a variety of climbing from sharp granite boulders of Wamberal, to the loose sandstone of Bouddi National Park.  Most locations are within easy reach of roads, but some require traipsing across private or government property so please be descrete and do not create too much of an impact on the surrounding areas.  Many of the coasts' climbers have seen the over-usage of the Berowra area and do not wish for the same to happen on the coast so please respect their wishes and do not crowd the area.<br>
