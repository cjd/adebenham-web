<BODY><H1>Climbing Safety</h1>
<p><B>Climbing is a dangerous sport. If you are not a hundred percent confident in your ability, your gear and the ability of the person/s setting up <i>do not</i> continue until you are. Use of this information without proper training/experience could result in death or injury so don't bet your life on what you read</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The first thing to do is get an experienced instructor to teach you safety<br>
The second thing to do is read the <a href=srccode.html class=link>Climbers Code of Conduct</a><br>
</p>

<p>
When you are about to climb always double-check everything. A good way to remember this is <i>ABCDE</i><br>
</p>

<p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>A - Anchor </b> </td><td>Check you anchor points. When top roping this means both the top anchors and your belay anchor, when leading this refers to your belay anchor if you are using one</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>B - Buckles</b></td><td>Check that all buckles on your harness are doubled back. Do not forget to check buckles on your leg loops</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>C - Carabiners</b></td><td>Make sure all carabiners are done up properly. It is a good guideline to do each up fully then back off half a turn.  Carabiners can tighten while being used and so may be hard to undo unless you back them off a fraction</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>D - Devices</b></td><td>Check your belay device. Is the rope passing through freely and can you lock of correctly. Also make sure that the rope is going in the correct direction for you to belay with your strongest hand<br>
If you are top-roping check your top pulley or whatever you are using for the top</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>E - Everything Else</b></td><td>This is the catch all for anything not covered above. Check things such as whether you have enough quickdraws and bolt covers for the run if climbing sport climbs, enough gear for trad climbs and enough rope for top roping :-)</td></tr>
</table>

A useful quick tip is to <b>never</b> let insect repellant touch your climbing rope.<br>
Most repellants contain a substance that will eat through nylon ropes and so even spraying the rope with repellant may weaken the rope.  Whenever you need to use repellant use it downwind from your (and others) ropes.
