<H1>Sport Climbs</h1>
<H2>Blackwall Mountain</H2>
I saw 10 bolted sport routes and 3 ringbolted overhangs which might need some trad gear placed between ringbolts and lots of top rope possibilities<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
From the rip bridge heading towards Woy Woy turn left onto picnic pde, then turn left onto flathead road, then turn left onto Booker bay road, follow under bridge then turn left onto Mullbong road, drive to end.<BR>Do not take fire trail, use foot track to the left of the fire trail follow up hill about 250m then as you guessed take left fork in track up steep rock steps follow track through rocks, when you are there you will know it.<BR>
<H2>Palmdale</H2>
Two climbing spots either side of the road.<BR>Most runs look 24+<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Head out to Palmdale (near the crematorium).<BR>Drive towards the National park.<BR>About 2km along the dirt road you will pass through a road cutting. Park just past this.<BR>The climbs are on either side of the road here<BR>

The road is a logging road and gets rough.<BR>OK in most cars, but DO NOT take a lowered car if you wish to keep your exhaust<BR><BR>
<H2>Patonga</H2>
Fairly long section of cliffs near patonga.<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Head out to patonga.<BR>When you reach the top of the hill before patonga drive until you hit a long straight section.<BR>On the left there is a trail to Warrah Lookout.<BR>Climbs surround the lookout<BR>
Warning: Climbing is currently banned in this area.<BR><BR>
<H2>Phegans Bay</H2>
There is a range of climbs starting from around grade 14. Most are bolted, however some anchor points have been bashed in on main face (see further on for more information about this)<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
From the freeway take the Gosford exit, turn onto Woy Woy road at the second lights in Kariong.<BR>Follow Woy Woy road past the fixed speed camera, turn at Woy Woy Bay rd then first right down Olive av. Go straight through the crossroad to end of Olive av follow the track track round to the rocks.<BR>

<H2>Reeves Street</H2>
The is a large slab, a nice crack climb, an overhang and more around the back<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Reeves street is off manns road between west gosford and narara, the turnoff is right on a corner. Drive to end of road onto the dirt section until you can't drive any further. Park at the end here but do not block access for the house at the end. Follow track about 100 metres to base of climbs.<BR>

<H2>Wards Hill</H2>
A surprisngly impressive crag located right beside Ward's Hill Rd, Empire Bay.<BR>The crag has two distinct walls - the first is a nice looking 10m high grey wall with 5 or 6 mainly bolted routes (old carrots plus some rather mangled fixed hangers). The main wall is a bit further on, and reaches about 20m in height, with superb orange rock at the base. There look to be about another half dozen routes or so on this wall, with a variety of carrots and fixed hangers for protection.<BR><BR><BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
To get to the crag, park in the carpark at the top of the hill (at the corner of Ward's Hill Rd and Maitland Bay Drive) and find a track that heads off into the bush, parallel to Ward's Hill Rd. Alternatively, you can walk down Ward's Hill road (take care!) to the first hairpin, and follow a track off to the right that leads up to the crag.<BR>

<IMG SRC="../Sport/Wards_Hill/map.png" ALT=Map BORDER=0><BR>
All of the routes here look to be 20+.<BR><BR>
<H2>West Gosford</H2>
A neat little crag just behind Hardware House at West Gosford<BR>There is also a smaller area located on Debenham Road.<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Drive out West Gosford then head along Manns Road until you reach Stockyard Place then turn at the traffic lights up Stockyard Place towards Hardware house (also called Bunnings Hardware) and park at the end of that road.<BR>The crag is just up and to the right of the road.<BR>

<H1>Traditional Climbs</h1>
<H2>Bouddi National Park</H2>
Bouddi National Park  is a small national park on the central coast of NSW. Although it's very small, it does have some quite large sea cliffs similar to those found in Sydney (Bouddi is part of the same region of sandstone). These are generally areas of active erosion, and are loose, unstable and unsuitable for climbing. There are also some inland cliffs which contain most of the climbing. Many of these are at the heads of gullies, and can be quite wet and slimy, particularly after rain.<BR><BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Head out to Wagstaffe then turn somewhere, exact location is unknown at the moment, but if you discover then please email us.<BR>

<B>Start:</B> The face below the obvious lookout rock platform. 15m left of the chossy roof<BR>
The face below the obvious lookout rock platform. 15m left of the chossy roof, past the ramp that leads to the lookout platform.  A fairly steep face, with plenty of crimpy handholds down low, and jugs near the top. Good anchors on top, although they are well back from the edge. Seems to have been climbed (or abseiled?) before, as one of the anchor rocks up the top is quite chipped<BR>

<SPAN CLASS=text></SPAN><BR><BR>
<H3 CLASS=section>Bullima Spur</H3>
<SPAN CLASS=text>A long series of buttresses up to about 25m in height, located on the eastern side of the Bullima Spur just south of Maitland Bay. Most of the buttresses are accessed via the Bullima Spur walking track, which branches off the Maitland Bay walking track not far from the Maitland Bay car park. The track initially passes a boulder field that looks like it could have some potential for good bouldering (perhaps after some cleaning).   To get to the first set of walls (where all of the following climbs are), ignore the Bullima Spur track and continue down the Maitland Bay track until it passes down between two huge boulders (at the bottom and to the left is a small bouldering area sheltered from the rain). The track then veers right and down into a creek and then turns back left. At this point leave the track and head straight across the creek and up the other side to the top of the cliff. Two small descent gullies split the cliff just here.  The following climbs have probably been done before, so the names probably aren't correct.  </SPAN><BR><BR>
<B>The Arete</B>
<IMG SRC="../images/Traditional.gif" ALT="Traditional">
8m 20<BR>
<B>Start:</B> Left of descent gully<BR>
The blunt arete just to the left of the descent gully. Scramble up to the waist high ledge then up on small, sharp crimps to the large, sloping break. Doddle up the top section on jugs.<BR>

10m 22<BR>
<B>Start:</B> 5m left of the blunt arete<BR>
Scramble onto the waist high ledge, then up, using the well-worn dish, the vertical intrusion on the left and some slopers on the shield formation. Pretty awful top-out, but a good belay using cams on a block about 5m back.<BR>
<SPAN CLASS=text></SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<H3 CLASS=section>Little Lobster</H3>
<SPAN CLASS=text>The Little Lobster crag is uphill from Little Lobster beach (which is about 500m North of Lobster Beach). It features a massive 10m roof (which might even be climbable!), plus some smaller rooves, and some nice looking slabs at the southern end. The rock was wet from rain when we climbed here, so much of the crag we only looked at. Some potential for good climbs.  To get there, follow the directions for Dog Face. Where the track branches off right to Dog Face, the massive roof is straight in front of you, over the top of the ridge. You can either rap in (anchor off two trees at all times!), or you can head right until it's possible to scramble down to the base of the cliff. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<B>Moss City</B>
<IMG SRC="../images/Traditional.gif" ALT="Traditional">
15m 17/18<BR>
<B>Start:</B> In the middle of the nice slab at the southern end of the crag<BR>
Up a very thin face then right to a small ledge. Straight up from the ledge, being very careful of crumbly rock (the hole to the right is very crumbly). The bottom section was virtually impossible after two days of rain, as it was covered in moss and slime. A toothbrush for cleaning holds is recommended.<BR>
<SPAN CLASS=text>Got to <A href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/4455/bouddi_pictures.html#moss_city" target=_new>Peter monks site</a> for a photo</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS=text></SPAN><BR><BR>
<H3 CLASS=section>South Lobster</H3>
<SPAN CLASS=text>The orange face visible high up on the southern headland of Lobster Beach.  The obvious way to get there is to bush bash up the hill from the beach, although it's pretty hard going. A better alternative is to follow the "flannel flower" track up to the top of the ridge. At the top there's a faint walking track that heads off to the right along the top of the ridge above the southern end of the beach. Follow this for 500m or so until it starts to drop down. At this point the cliff is off to the right, a short distance down from the top of the ridge.  About 20m left of the main orange face is a nice looking slabby face about 12m high. The middle of the face looks like it would be leadable (numerous horizontal breaks), and pretty easy. </SPAN><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC=../images/star.gif ALT="*"><IMG SRC=../images/star.gif ALT="*"><B>15plus</B>
<IMG SRC="../images/Traditional.gif" ALT="Traditional">
12m 21<BR>
<B>Start:</B> On the face 5m to the left of the fallen block<BR>
An excellent climb shaded by a large tree, but don't forget the SPF15+ (hence the name) since it faces north and bakes. On the face 5m to the left of the fallen block, distinguished by 3 vertical cracks and a chossy, windblown cave at ground level. 15+ is the left crack, and starts on the ledge beside the smallish blackbutt eucalypt. Pull out along the vertical wall under the roof, being careful of loose rock. Reach up around the lip for a large jug then crank out onto the main face. Hand jams in the bottom of the crack, while higher up only fingers will fit. Crux move up thin face to the juggy lip. Probably good pro in the crack (small cams), but next to no anchors on top (a large red gum about 15m back from the edge is good, but less than convenient).<BR>

A word of warning before anyone climbs in Bouddi. The park has seen little or no climbing, so many of the edges and thinner pieces of rock will snap off if you as much as breathe on them. Even the larger holds aren't necessarily safe, so be careful. We top-roped all the climbs listed below, with most of them being unleadable face climbs. Where I mention good protection, I mean I would feel safe placing protection on these climbs, were I to lead them. I'd recommend wearing a helmet and top-roping all climbs before leading, however, just to test out the rock and placements.<BR><BR>Since the crags listed below are within the boundaries of the National Park, bolts should not be placed on the rock. Aside from ethical considerations, I believe the placement of new bolts in Australian National Parks is illegal. <BR><BR>This location was copied from Peter Monks website (Goto 'links' to find the site)<BR><BR>
<H1>Hybrid Climbs</h1>
<H2>Hawkesbury River</H2>
The hawkesbury is an area of sandstone surrounding a river and includes areas such as Cottage Point, Suicide Slabs and the Wondabyne area.<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Getting there depends on which location you are heading to. Some places are only accessable by train, some areas only by boat while some can be driven to.<BR>
The Hawkesbury River is covered by the Sydney Rockclimbing guide at www.sydneyclimbing.com.<BR>For the section relating to Hawkesbury click the following link. <A href="http://www.sydneyclimbing.com/xgo_hawkesbury_river.html">http://www.sydneyclimbing.com/xgo_hawkesbury_river.html</a><BR><BR>
<H2>Jolls Bridge</H2>
A long section of cliffs sitting right beside the freeway.  Varied grades of climbs with heights of up to 45m. Most climbs require mixed gear with some sport routes.<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Travelling south on the freeway you hit the end of the 90kph zone.<BR>Turn off at the Brooklyn exit head north up the old pacific highway. A little way along you pass just below Jolls bridge. There is decent parking a bit further on.<BR>Walk up the hill directly below the bridge, pass under then head up beside the road to the top of the cliff.<BR>
A full guide is available at <a href=http://www.sydneyclimbing.com/xgo_jolls_bridge.html>http://www.sydneyclimbing.com/xgo_jolls_bridge.html</a><BR><BR>

A nice large cave with good overhanging runs and some pocketed routes as well as a 20m long flat wall and scattered boulders<BR>
<B>How to get there</B><BR>
Go up to rumbalara and go to the end of the road.<BR>At the end the road wraps back around itself and on the side there are some toilets. Park here.<BR>To get to the cave head directly down the hill from where the toilets are and it drops off.<BR>Get down this drop off and head left and you wil find a cave (very obvious as to which one as it is very large.<BR><BR>To get to the flat wall, head back down the road  and follow the path to your right. It will meet up with a wide disabled walking trail. Continue along this trail until you reach a sculpture. Just past this there is a descent gully on the right that heads down to a path. The climbs are along this path in both directions.<BR>
