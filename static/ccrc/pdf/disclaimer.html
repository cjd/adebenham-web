Rockclimbing is also in a vague area legally and it may be illegal/risky to climb at some of the locations/climbs mentioned.  Before climbing please check for any signs or guidelines which may restrict climbing and obey the local authorities.  Also refer to the guide and only park where it is safe/where recommended so that the local landowners/council do not get affected.
