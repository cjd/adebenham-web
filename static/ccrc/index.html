<center><h1> Welcome to The Central Coast Rockclimbing Website</h1></center>
<p>
Remember that Rockclimbing is a dangerous sport and neither the authors, the contributors or other associated person will take any responsibility for any damage to personal property, injury or death. Any climbing you do as a result of this guide is done at your own risk.<br>

We will only take responsibility as required under the dual-trunking clause which requires we support you if you climb using two male elephants as your belay point and initial clip-off point.
</p>
<p>
Rockclimbing is also in a vague area legally and it may be illegal/risky to climb at some of the locations/climbs mentioned. Before climbing please check for any signs or guidelines which may restrict climbing and obey the local authorities.<br>
Also refer to the guide and only park where it is safe/where recommended so that the local landowners/council do not get affected. If people park/act irresponsibly it may have lasting effects on access to climbing locations.
