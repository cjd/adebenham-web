I live on the [Central Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_\(New_South_Wales\)) of NSW, Australia which is about 75km north of Sydney Australia.  
Since Jan 2018 I have been employed by [Google](http://www.google.com) as a Staff Technical Supportability Engineer located in the Pyrmont.  
I previously spent 19 years at [Sun Microsystems](https://www.sun.com/)/[Oracle](https://oracle.com) in variety of roles starting in Internal IT (ENS), moving to the SunOnline team in Technical Sales as a Systems Engineer and then through various roles supporting Solaris ending as a Principal Technical Support Engineer working on Solaris core OS.  
I attended the [University of Technology, Sydney](http://www.uts.edu.au) where I completed a Bachelor of Science (Computing Science).
