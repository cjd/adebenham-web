[![Hacker logo](glider-small.png)](http://catb.org/hacker-emblem/)

I live in Gosford, NSW, Australia which is about 75km north of Sydney Australia (you know, that place with the bridge and funky shaped opera house).

I currently work for [Google](http://www.google.com) as a Senior Technical Supportability Engineer located in the Pyrmont.
I attended the [University of Technology, Sydney](http://www.uts.edu.au) where I completed a Bachelor of Science (Computing Science).
