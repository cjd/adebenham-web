My LED shirt is actually an apron I wear under a plain t-shirt (so the shirt can still be washed ðŸ˜‰) It is made from a 5m led strip running on 5V The strip is 150 individual WS2811 pixels split into 15 sections of 10 pixels. The entire strip is connected to a Pixel-Wifi (ESPPixelstick clone) powered by a small USB battery. The Pixel-Wifi support E1.31 so the shirt is treated as a small matrix in my display. I made the apron from some fabric scraps my wife had â€“ the strips are then sewn onto the apron with some electrical tape keeping them in spot.
