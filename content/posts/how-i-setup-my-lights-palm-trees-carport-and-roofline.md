We have three large palm trees in the yard â€“ the middle one supports the mega tree while on the two other I have attached two 5m strips (split into four 2.5m sections) to each tree.

Along the guttering I have attached pixel strip. The strip is cable-tied to electrical conduit (to keep it straight) and the conduit connects to clips attached to the underside of the guttering.

I the carport I have attached strips via cable-tie. One strip for each cross-member (four in total)
