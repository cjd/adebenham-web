I've had this blog sitting here blank for a fair while now and so I figured it is about time I did something with it.

I work in Sun as a backline OS engineer and have a major interest in Linux along with Solaris.

I've recently got into electronics and am in the progress of making a Arduino controlled lighting box and also am designing my own little robot.

In this blog I'll attempt to document the lighting box and whatever else I get around to making.

I also have a habit of writing lots of little scripts/fixes so I'll post them here as well anything else that comes to mind

Here's hoping I actually remember to do any of this :-)
