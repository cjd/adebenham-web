title: MTPFS 1.1 - Now supporting multiple storage areas

I am now the proud owner of an Asus Transformer tablet (not the prime) and so wanted to update mtpfs to work better with it.

The biggest change was to add support for multiple storage areas.   Now when you mount a MTP device which has internal storage and a MicroSD card (or similar) it shows up as two separate directories which you can access.

The download is available from [mtpfs page](/mtpfs/ "MTPfs")
