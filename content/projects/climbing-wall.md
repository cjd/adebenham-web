I while back I built a home bouldering wall.
Below I have the plans for it and some images of the building process and finished product
The basic design is 2400mm x 2400mm with an additional 600mm section that can be added to the top.
The entire wall pivots on hinges attached to the base and can be raised/lowered using the chains that hold the top.
A section is cutout from the left side which is there to clear a window on my garage wall (where the final wall resides).

## Wall plans

The wall plans are in dxf format and were created using [QCad](www.qcad.org) on Solaris.
All up the wall (excluding holds) cost me about $AU400.
