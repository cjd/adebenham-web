xLights is a free and open source program that enables you to design, create and play amazing lighting displays through the use of DMX controllers, E1.31 Ethernet controllers and more.
It runs on Windows, OSX and Linux.
For more information see [http://xlights.org](http://xlights.org)

For all linux distros (x86\_64 only) I am creating [AppImage](http://appimage.org) builds.  These are now auto-built whenever a new release is tagged and can be found at [https://github.com/xLightsSequencer/xLights/releases](https://github.com/xLightsSequencer/xLights/releases)

To install simply download the most recent, set it executable (for example 'chmod +x ./xLights-x86\_64.AppImage') and then run directly.
